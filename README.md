# Bowling-Game-Scoring-

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to create a software application that calculates and tracks scores for a game of bowling. The application simulates the scoring process of a real bowling game, where players roll a ball to knock down pins in an attempt to achieve the highest score possible.

Functionality
The application allows users to:

Start a new game of bowling.
Input the number of pins knocked down in each roll of the game.
Automatically calculate and update the scores for each frame based on the rules of bowling.
View the current score and frame details during the game.
Handle edge cases and special scenarios such as strikes, spares, and the final frame.

## Logic
Logic
The scoring logic follows the standard rules of bowling:

Each game consists of 10 frames, with the potential for an extra frame in the case of a spare or strike in the 10th frame.
A player has two rolls per frame, except for the 10th frame which may have up to three rolls.
The score for each frame is determined by the number of pins knocked down in that frame, plus bonuses for strikes and spares.
Strikes (knocking down all pins with the first roll) and spares (knocking down all pins with two rolls) have specific scoring rules.
The total score is the sum of the scores for all frames, including any bonuses.
